# Learning Analytics Class Activity 1

Class activity allowing students to collect, analyze and apply insight from data to a learning task.

In this activity you will be using sensor data from your mobile phone to measure performance on a physical task. You will use this data to analyze the performance of a novice and expert at the task and then apply your understanding of the data ti improve the performance of the novice.

### Step 1

In groups of **four** discuss physical activities that **at least one person** in your group could be considered an **expert** and **at least one person** in your group could be considered a **novice** (For example, shooting a basketball). 

### Step 2

Download the Sensor Kinetics Pro App ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sensor-kinetics-pro/id623633248?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innoventions.sensorkineticspro)), play with the app and discuss the meaning of the different measures available within it. Ensure that all memebers of your group understand what the app measures.

### Step 3

Discuss how the measures from the Sensor Kinetics app could be used to study the activity you discused in step 1. How will you attach the phone to the individual without impacting their performance too greatly? How will you interpret the data genertated by the app? Can you predict how the data might differ between the novice and the expert? How many people from your group will be involved in the activity? What ethical considerations do you need to conider in collecting this data?

### Step 4

Design and implement your data collection strategy. 

### Step 5

Analyze your collected data, looking for differences in the measures between your novice and expert particpants. Develop a theory of learning that explains the difference in measures between the novice and expert. How would you validate your theory?

### Step 6

Using your new understanding of the activity in terms of the measures you collected and your theory of learning, advise the novice on how to improve their performance. Will use use visualizations, explanations, practice exercises?

### Step 7

After advising your novice group member on how to improve re-measure their performance and determine from the data whether they improved? How confident are you that your advice helped them improve? How could you validiate this intervention?
